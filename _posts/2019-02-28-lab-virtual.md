Everything is a trade, if you not have an powerfull machine you will need at least a good internet connection +15Mbps. Or if you luck enough ($$$$$) to have an <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/core/i9-processors/i9-9900k.html">i9</a>, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/xeon/w-processors.html"> Xeon </a> or <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-threadripper-2990wx"> Threadripper </a> you are good to go.

## My home lab

Here I'm have a mixed balanced situation: Old i7-2600k and Internet bandwidth *50Mbps* stated by the ISP but let's give a credit is good enough to *labbing*. Just remenber that in some situations memory is like $$$ more is better...lol
Well we trying to make lab in affordable way. So we try use as much as possible a free for personal use software or GNU/GPL, MIT ones. 
Here is a list of software that we can use:

- Linux (Choose your flavor...Lol Great quality software. For this purpose I use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)
- VMware Workstation Player (Choose your version...)
- Microsoft Azure Cloud (Free $$$/time trial)
- Google Cloud (Free $$$ trial)
- GNS3
- Eve-NG Community
- Cisco VIRL (Free using via #Devnet)
- Iso's from Ubuntu, CentOS and Microsoft (Trial)
